# Tutorials

Learn Amigo through a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates trajectory optimization for a classic optimal control problem.

## Cart Pole Swing-up

The [Cart Pole tutorial](./cart-pole.md) provides an in-depth introduction to trajectory optimization using Amigo. This comprehensive example covers:

- Complete mathematical problem formulation
- Nonlinear dynamics implementation
- Discretization using trapezoidal collocation
- Boundary condition specification
- Direct transcription optimization
- Results visualization and analysis

This tutorial demonstrates all essential concepts needed to solve optimal control problems with Amigo, from problem definition through to solution analysis.

## Running the Example

The complete code is available in the examples directory:

```bash
cd amigo/examples/cart
python cart_pole.py --build
```

Start with the [Cart Pole tutorial](./cart-pole.md) to learn trajectory optimization with Amigo.
