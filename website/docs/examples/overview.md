# Examples Overview

This section contains examples demonstrating various applications of Amigo for optimization and optimal control problems.

## Available Examples

- **[Brachistochrone Problem](./brachistochrone.md)**: A classic calculus of variations problem that finds the fastest path for a particle sliding between two points under gravity. This example demonstrates trajectory optimization with free final time.

- **[Cart-Pole Tutorial](../tutorials/cart-pole.md)**: A comprehensive tutorial on solving the inverted pendulum problem. This example provides detailed explanations of the direct transcription method and component-based modeling.
